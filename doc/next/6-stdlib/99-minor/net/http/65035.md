[Transport]'s limit on 1xx informational responses received
in response to a request has changed.
It previously aborted a request and returned an error after
receiving more than 5 1xx responses.
It now returns an error if the total size of all 1xx responses
exceeds the [Transport.MaxResponseHeaderBytes] configuration setting.

In addition, when a request has a
[net/http/httptrace.ClientTrace.Got1xxResponse]
trace hook, there is now no limit on the total number of 1xx responses.
The `Got1xxResponse` hook may return an error to abort a request.
